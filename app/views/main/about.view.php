        of programming began with a fascination for building dynamic and scalable web applications, and it led
        me to specialize in PHP development.

        With 3 of hands-on experience, I've delved deep into crafting robust websites using PHP and also other
        web frameworks like Laravel and Vue.js. I also have a deep passion for the Linux community, where was
        part of the initial translations into a few South African languages in 2009.
