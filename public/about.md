# About Me

Hello, I'm Relebogile, a technology and engineering enthusiast from South Africa. I love building web applications that
are dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly. I hold a 3-year Diploma in information technology from the University of South
Africa [UNISA](https://www.unisa.ac.za), and I'm currently pursuing an advanced diploma in information resource management. I also have a
background in mining, where I worked as a technician and a trainer for eight years.

# Skills

I have a wide range of skills in web development, software development, and database design. Some of the technologies I
use are:

- HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, and Tailwind for web interfaces
- VB.NET and C# for .NET framework applications
- Kotlin for Android applications
- SQL for database management
- Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, PHPStorm, and Git for development and deployment tools
- Oracle Cloud and Linux for server administration

# Previous Roles

Before switching to IT, I was an earthmoving equipment technician, specializing in surface drilling rigs. I was
responsible for optimizing fleet reliability, implementing maintenance tools, and training apprentices in the mining
industry. This experience taught me valuable skills in leadership, adaptability, and problem-solving.

# Education

I graduated with a diploma in information technology from UNISA in 2023, where I learned the fundamentals of IT and
gained hands-on experience in various projects. I also have a qualification in earthmoving equipment mechanics, where I
focused on opencast drilling equipment. In 2024, I'm pursuing an NQF7 advanced diploma in information resource
management, where I hope to learn more about managing information systems and resources.
